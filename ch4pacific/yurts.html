            <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen size bed with down quit and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
                camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
                restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light
                layers of clothing. It is also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
